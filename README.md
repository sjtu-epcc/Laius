# Acknowledgement
Abacus is collaboratively developed by the EPCC Lab, led by Quan Chen at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Lenovo.
We sincerely thank Liming Xiao and other contributors from Lenovo for their valuable efforts.
Since February 2019, they have provided substantial support in integrating CUDA MPS into a process pool with distinct resource quotas.
Their insights, code contributions, and thoughtful discussions have significantly enhanced the quality and robustness of the project.
